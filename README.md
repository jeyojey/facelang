# Face-Tracking Language Learning
This web application enables users to interactively select translation words on a webpage using facial movement recognition. By leveraging computer vision, the user's head movements are tracked in real-time, allowing them to navigate and pick words simply by moving their head. This innovative approach provides a hands-free, immersive experience for language learning. It's particularly useful for individuals with speech or typing disabilities, and it also encourages gentle neck movement, making it a beneficial tool for stretching during work hours while learning new languages.
